**TODO:**  

Does our data support 'importability', i.e. change in reliability statistic depending on sample size?
Plot 'effect size' (for meaningful measures) and 'test-retest reliability' for randomly sampled samples of n.
Is it because we don't have as many trials PER CONDITION?
How is are test-retest correlations corrected for attenuation (Table 1 - https://github.com/PerceptionAndCognitionLab/ctx-reliability/blob/public/papers/submission/p.Rmd#L420)?

**Exceprts**  

"Figure 1 shows a lack of portability in these two measures. We randomly selected
different subsets of the Hedge et al.’s data and computed effect sizes and test-retest
reliabilities. We varied the number of trials per condition per individual from 20 to 400, and
for each level, we collected 100 different randomly-chosen subsets. For each subset, we
computed effect size and reliability, and plotted are the means across these 100 subsets. The
line denoted “S” shows the case for the Stroop task, and both effect size and reliability
measures increase appreciably with the number of trials per condition per individual. The
line denoted “F” is from Hedge et al.’s flanker task, and the results are similar. In fact, these
increases with the number of replicates are a general property of tasks. Measures that are
treated as properties of the task are critically tied to sample sizes. In summary, classical
measures are portable when applied to instruments because the numbers of items are fixed.
They are importable when applied to task performance where the number of trials per
individual will vary across studies"

"The above real-world demonstration that sample estimates of correlations are so badly
attenuated should be alarming. The one-block case was based on a design with 48 trials per
individual per condition. This is a typical number for individual-difference batteries with a
large number of tasks. Yet, the attenuation is so severe that test-retest correlations are
barely detectable. No wonder observed correlations across tasks are so low. The hierarchical
model provides a more sensitive view of the structure in the data by allowing for shrinkage
to a regression line."
