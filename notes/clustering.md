# Concepts

- eigenvalue: amount of variance explained by each PC
- coordinate/correlation: the correlation between the variable and the PC
- quality of representation: squared correlation; how well the variable is represented by the PC; variance of variable explained by the PC
- contribution: variance of PC explained by the variable
- Factor loadings (variables)
- Factor scores (individuals)
