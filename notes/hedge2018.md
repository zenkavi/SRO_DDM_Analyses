## Notes on: Hedge, C., Powell, G., Bompas, A., Vivian-Griffiths, S., & Sumner, P. (2018). Low and variable correlation between reaction time costs and accuracy costs explained by accumulation models: Meta-analysis and simulations. Psychological bulletin, 144(11), 1200.

**TODO:**  

Check correlation between error and rt costs within task
Effect of number of trials on this correlation
Egger's test and trim and fill analysis for retest literature data
RT-error cost correlation wrt variance in drift rates and thresholds Figure 6
  panel 1: y=error cost, x=threshold, color = drift rates
  panel 2: y=RT cost, x=threshold, color = drift rates

**Excerpts**  

"RT costs are not a pure index of individual
differences in the theoretical mechanisms that they are frequently
used to represent; and if variance between individuals arises from
both task-specific and general processing factors, it can become
difficult to interpret correlations."

"If participants vary in both accumulation rate (selection efficiency)
and threshold, then an overall correlation between error
and RT costs is not expected, despite both being outcomes of the
same decision and control mechanisms. We illustrate that this is
not a feature of any specific model, but a property the family
shares. Thus, the framework of accumulator models appears fruitful
for understanding individual differences in performance on
choice decision tasks."

"Alternatively, a tendency for studies with small sample
sizes to show stronger effects is typically interpreted as an indication
of publication bias, as small studies with nonsignificant
effects are less likely to be published"
