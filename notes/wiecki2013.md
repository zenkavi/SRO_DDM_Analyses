## Notes on: Wiecki, T. V., Sofer, I., & Frank, M. J. (2013). HDDM: hierarchical bayesian estimation of the drift-diffusion model in python. Frontiers in neuroinformatics, 7, 14.

**TODO:**  

Can I compare flat vs hierarchical for each parameter and number of trials separately?

**Exceprts**

"The differences between the hierarchical and non-hierarchical
methods in parameter recovery are mainly noticeable for the
decision threshold and the two drift rates for every number
of trials we tested, and it is most profound when the number
of trials is very small"
