## Notes on: Ratcliff, R., & Childers, R. (2015). Individual differences and fitting methods for the two-choice diffusion model of decision making. Decision, 2(4), 237.

" Two issues were examined, first, what sizes of differences between groups can be obtained to distinguish between
groups and second, what sizes of differences would be needed to find individual subjects that had a deficit relative to a control group."

Individual difference (ID) analyses:
- Correlating ID variables with other (e.g. real-world variables) - external validity. This would be capped by a theoretical upper limit for the correlations
- Comparing ID variables to a control group to designate as 'abnormal' - predictive validity (?)

One argument for using the same model that putatively captures the same processes across all tasks (or using a small number of tasks instead of large batteries for ID analyses) is that if the components of cognitive processes differ across tasks then deficits might be averaged out when using different tasks/metrics. (p 3, pp1)

"It is important to distinguish between different sources of variability relevant to applications of the diffusion model. Variability across subjects in the parameters of the model from the fits to each subject's data (SD's) can be used to determine if a parameter value for an individual is significantly different from the values for the group. Standard errors across subjects can be used to determine whether a parameter for one group differs significantly from the parameter for another group. These standard errors represent the variability in the group means and they can be made smaller by increasing the number of subjects in the group."

"In typical applications of the diffusion model, this source of variability [sampling variability ie. that due to difference in number of observations per subject] is typically 3 to 5 times smaller than the variability due to differences among individuals for 45 min. of data collection. "

What is 'non-hierarchical HDDM (Wiecki, Sofer, & Frank, 2013),'?

'Hierarchical methods have been demonstrated to be superior to standard methods when there are low numbers of observations per subject' - for us a test of this could be comparing the difference between EZ and HDDM or HDDM hier vs flat wrt number of tasks in each task.

'One of the most important functions of the diffusion model is that it maps RT and accuracy onto common underlying components of processing, drift rates, boundary settings, and nondecision time, which allows direct comparisons between tasks and conditions that might show the effects of independent variables in different ways.'

'We used the package to fit the data from each subject individually in the same way as for the other methods.' - ie flat estimates
'For the first two simulation studies, we examined separate fits to individual subjects. We also compared parameters recovered from the hierarchical method with those recovered from the chi-square method. '
